The srcjar directory is not on the classpath. It is a staging and reference 
directory for temporary placement of dependency jar file source prior to and 
after conversion to JavaScript. 

The src2 directory is used to actually build the .js files, as it is on the
class path. See README_SWINGJS.txt there.
