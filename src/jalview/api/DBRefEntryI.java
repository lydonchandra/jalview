   * SequenceI.getPrimaryDbRefs(). <br>
   * Primary references indicate the local sequence data directly corresponds
   * with the database record. All other references are secondary. Direct
   * references indicate that part or all of the local sequence data can be
   * mapped with another sequence, enabling annotation transfer.
   * Cross-references indicate the local sequence data can be corresponded to
   * some other linear coordinate system via a transformation. <br>
   * This method is also sufficient to distinguish direct DBRefEntry mappings
   * from other relationships - e.g. coding relationships (imply a 1:3/3:1
   * mapping), but not transcript relationships, which imply a (possibly
   * non-contiguous) 1:1 mapping.
