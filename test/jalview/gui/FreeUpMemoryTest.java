/**
 * Provides a simple test that memory is released when all windows are closed.
 * <ul>
 * <li>generates a reasonably large alignment and loads it</li>
 * <li>performs various operations on the alignment</li>
 * <li>closes all windows</li>
 * <li>requests garbage collection</li>
 * <li>asserts that the remaining memory footprint (heap usage) is 'not large'
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * If the test fails, this means that reference(s) to large object(s) have
 * failed to be garbage collected. In this case:
 * <ul>
 * <li>set a breakpoint just before the test assertion in
 * {@code checkUsedMemory}</li>
 * <li>if the test fails intermittently, make this breakpoint conditional on
 * {@code usedMemory > expectedMax}</li>
 * <li>run the test to this point (and check that it is about to fail i.e.
 * {@code usedMemory > expectedMax})</li>
 * <li>use <a href="https://visualvm.github.io/">visualvm</a> to obtain a heap
 * dump from the suspended process (and kill the test or let it fail)</li>
 * <li>inspect the heap dump using visualvm for large objects and their
 * referers</li>
 * <li>Tips:</li>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Perform GC from the Monitor view in visualvm before requesting the heap
 * dump - test failure might be simply a delay to GC</li>
 * <li>View 'Objects' and filter classes to {@code jalview}. Sort columns by
 * Count, or Size, and look for anything suspicious. For example, if the object
 * count for {@code Sequence} is non-zero (it shouldn't be), pick any instance,
 * and follow the chain of {@code references} to find which class(es) still hold
 * references to sequence objects</li>
 * <li>If this chain is impracticably long, re-run the test with a smaller
 * alignment (set width=100, height=10 in {@code generateAlignment()}), to
 * capture a heap which is qualitatively the same, but much smaller, so easier
 * to analyse; note this requires an unconditional breakpoint</li>
 * </ul>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <h2>Fixing memory leaks</h2>
 * <p>
 * Experience shows that often a reference is retained (directly or indirectly)
 * by a Swing (or related) component (for example a {@code MouseListener} or
 * {@code ActionListener}). There are two possible approaches to fixing:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Purist: ensure that all listeners and similar objects are removed when no
 * longer needed. May be difficult, to achieve and to maintain as code
 * changes.</li>
 * <li>Pragmatic: null references to potentially large objects from Jalview
 * application classes when no longer needed, typically when a panel is closed.
 * This ensures that even if the JVM keeps a reference to a panel or viewport,
 * it does not retain a large heap footprint. This is the approach taken in, for
 * example, {@code AlignmentPanel.closePanel()} and
 * {@code AnnotationPanel.dispose()}.</li>
 * <li>Adjust code if necessary; for example an {@code ActionListener} should
 * act on {@code av.getAlignment()} and not directly on {@code alignment}, as
 * the latter pattern could leave persistent references to the alignment</li>
 * </ul>
 * Add code to 'null unused large object references' until the test passes. For
 * a final sanity check, capture the heap dump for a passing test, and satisfy
 * yourself that only 'small' or 'harmless' {@code jalview} object instances
 * (such as enums or singletons) are left in the heap.
