Jalview 2.11.1.0 is the first minor release in the 2.11 series, and introduces a new 'point release' versioning model. The release includes a range of improvements including 'virtual features', which provide a more flexible way of mapping sequence features between protein products and their coding regions. This release also features an updated Jalview installer which adds improved memory management on OSX and Windows for large memory systems, and for linux users - a bundled Java installation and file associations for common filetypes handled by the Jalview application.
