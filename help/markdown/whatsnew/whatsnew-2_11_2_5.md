Jalview 2.11.2.5 is the fifth patch release in the 2.11.2 series. It includes several minor revisions, including a revised Pfam alignment retrieval client based on the Interpro web API, and a fix for a bug where overlapping features of the same type assigned different colours were not shown as coloured differently in the overview window.
