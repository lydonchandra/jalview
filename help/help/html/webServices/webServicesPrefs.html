    <strong>The Web Services Preferences Dialog Box</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Jalview includes a range of web services clients for data retrieval
    and analysis. The <em>Web Services</em> menu found in each alignment
    window provides access to some of these services, and is configured
    <em>via</em> the web services preference dialog box, available from
    the <em>Preferences</em> panel from the <strong>Tools&#8594;Preferences...</strong>
    menu from the Jalview Desktop window's menu bar.

  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Configuring the list of JABAWS servers</strong><br> The
    main area of the panel shows the list of <a href="JABAWS.html">JABAWS</a>
    servers that Jalview is currently aware of. The list includes a
    colour coded status: green indicates that all services are available
    for a given server, amber signifies that one or more services on the
    server are not fully functional, and red highlights servers that
    could not be contacted or are not functional for some other reason.
  </p>
  <p>
    A server's URL may be added, edited by double clicking on it, or
    deleted by selecting it and using the buttons below. After adding or
    editing a server's URL, you will be asked if you wish to test the
    server. If you wish to do so, then first ensure you can view the new
    server's test report, which will be output on Jalview's standard
    console output (you can open Jalview's built in console viewer via
    the <strong>Tools&#8594;Java Console</strong> menu option).
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Controlling the layout of the Web Services Menu</strong><br>
    The range of services that Jalview is able to access depends upon
    your requirements, and local computational resources. However, when
    a large number of resources are available, then the entries and sub
    menus in the <strong>web services</strong> menu can quickly become
    unwieldly. The options in the lower part of the dialog box enable
    you to control the display of each type of analysis service client
    in the web services menu. In addition, indexing options are provided
    that enable you to define the layout of the menus provided for
    JABAWS services by sorting them into submenus according to analysis
    type and/or host server.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>The web services preferences panel was added in Jalview
      2.6, and server status indications added in Jalview 2.8.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong><a name="wswarnings">Web Services Invalid URL
        warnings</a></strong><br> Jalview may inform you of any problems
    contacting the web services by showing a dialog box like the one
    below:<br>
  <center>
    <img src="invalidurldialog.gif" align="center"
      alt="Web Services Invalid URL Warning dialog box" width="389"
      height="258"><br> Web Services Invalid URL Warning
    dialog box
  </center>
  <br>
  <strong><em>Note:</em></strong> this warning will be shown if you are
  running the Jalview desktop without any network connection, or if you
  have configured
  <a href="JABAWS.html">JABA services</a> which cannot be accessed from
  your location. Should you wish to disable these warnings, then uncheck
  the
  <em>Display warnings</em> check box in the web services preferences.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>The web services warnings dialog box was added in Jalview
      2.6.1</em>
