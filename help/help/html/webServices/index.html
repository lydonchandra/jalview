    <strong>Web services</strong>
  </p>

  <p>Jalview includes clients for a variety of web services for both
    bioinformatic data retrieval and analysis.
  <ul>
    <li>The <a href="../features/seqfetch.html">Sequence
        Fetcher</a> utilises web services for sequence, alignment and
      structure retrieval provided by the European Bioinformatics
      Institute (EBI) and Distributed Annotation System servers that are
      capable of serving sequences.
    </li>
		<li>The <a href="dbreffetcher.html">Database Reference
				Fetcher</a> transfers database references and annotation from the public
			sequence databases.
		</li>
		<li>The <strong>Web Services</strong> menu in each alignment
      window also provides access to the following:
      <ul>
        <li>Programs for <a href="msaclient.html">multiple
            sequence alignment</a>, made available <em>via</em> <a
          href="JABAWS.html">Java Bioinformatic Analysis
            Web Service (JABAWS)</a> servers.
        </li>
        <li>Jalview SOAP Web Services for <a href="jnet.html">secondary
            structure prediction</a> based at the University of Dundee.
        </li>
        <li>Services for alignment analysis, such as <a
          href="shmr.html">Multi-Harmony</a>.
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Web Service Dialog Box</strong>
      </p> <img src="clwqueued.gif">
      <p>This dialog box is displayed when a web service job is
        submitted. It gives the name of the service and any method
        citation information, and monitors the progress of the
        calculation. The cancel button will permanently cancel the job,
        but this is only possible for some services.</p> The <a
      href="webServicesPrefs.html">Web Services Preference
        panel</a> controls the display and appearance of the submission and
      analysis services in the <strong>Web Services</strong> menu.
    </li>
    <li>If Jalview encounters problems accessing any services, it
      may display a <a href="webServicesPrefs.html#wswarnings">warning
        dialog box</a> (this can be turned off using the web services
      preferences tab).
    </li>
  </ul>

    <strong>More about Jalview's Web Services</strong> <br>
    Jalview's distributed computations utilise <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP">SOAP</a> and <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">REST</a>
    web services exposing sequence alignment, analysis, and secondary
    structure prediction programs. Originally, Jalview 2's services were
    maintained by the Barton group at the University of Dundee, and ran
    programs on the Life Sciences High-performance Computing Cluster.
    With the advent of <a href="http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jabaws">JABAWS</a>,
    however, it is possible for anyone to host Jalview web services.
