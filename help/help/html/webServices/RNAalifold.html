  <strong>RNAalifold RNA Alignment Secondary Structure
    Prediction Service</strong>
  <p>
    RNAalifold analyses the pattern of base pair conservation in an RNA
    alignment in order to predict a consensus secondary structure.<br>It
    is part of the <a href="http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/">Vienna
      RNA</a> Secondary Structure Prediction and Comparison Package. It was
    described in 2008 by Ivo L. Hofacker, Sebastian Will, Andreas R.
    Gruber, and Peter F. Stadler, <em>RNAalifold: Improved
      consensus structure prediction for RNA alignments</em> (BMC
    Bioinformatics, 9:474, 2008). Download the paper at <a
      href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/474">http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/474</a>.

  <p>
    <strong>Running RNAalifold from Jalview</strong><br />
  <p>
    Jalview supports access to RNAalifold services provided by JABA 2.1
    servers. To enable RNAalifold predictions for an RNA alignment, go
    to <strong>Webservices&rarr;Secondary Structure Prediction</strong>
    and select <strong>RNAalifold prediction</strong> to run with
    current defaults, and <strong>Change settings ...</strong> to adjust
    prediction parameters. The RNA secondary structure prediction for
    the alignment will be shown as alignment annotation, and any edits
    will trigger the prediction to be recalculated.
  <p>
    <Strong>RNAalifold prediction parameters</Strong> <br /> JABAWS and
    Jalview only provide access to a selection of the RNAalifold
    arguments. For a full description, see the documentation at <a
      href="http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/RNAalifold.html">http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/RNAalifold.html</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Supported Arguments which give alternate structures</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Partition Function (-p)</em><br /> Calculate the Partition
    Function and base pairing probability matrix in addition to the mfe
    structure. A coarse representation of the pair probabilities in the
    form of a pseudo bracket notation, as well as the centroid structure
    derived from the pair probabilities are displayed. The most likely
    base pairings are stored in a separate file by RNAalifold and
    represented in Jalview by a bar graph annotation line labeled
    'Contact Probabilities'.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Maximum Expected Accuracy Structure (--MEA)</em><br />
    Calculate an MEA structure where the expected Accuracy is computed
    from the base pair probabilities. A more detailed description can be
    found in the <strong>RNAfold</strong> program documentation at <a
      href="http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/RNAfold.html">http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/RNAfold.html</a>.
