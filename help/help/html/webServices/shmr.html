  <strong>Functional residue analysis with Sequence Harmony and
    Multi-Relief</strong>
  <p>
    The Multi-Harmony (a.k.a. Sequence Harmony and Multi-Relief, or
    SHMR) service (<a href="#shmrref">Brandt, Feenstra and Heringa,
      2010</a>) available from the <em>Analysis</em> sub-menu of the
    alignment window's web services menu provides a method for the
    identification of significant patterns of <em>sub-family
      variation</em> amongst the columns of an alignment.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Instructions for use</strong><br> The service requires
    a protein sequence multiple alignment that has been sub-divided into
    groups containing at least two non-identical protein sequences. An
    easy way to create groups is to use the built-in <a
      href="../calculations/tree.html">neighbour-joining or
      UPGMA tree</a> routines to calculate a tree for the alignment, and
    then click on the tree to subdivide the alignment.
  </p>
  <p>
    The SHMR service operates on the currently selected visible
    region(s) of the alignment. Once submitted, a job progress window
    will display status information about your job, including a URL
    which allows you to visit the status page on the <a
      href="http://zeus.few.vu.nl/programs/shmrwww/">IBIVU SHMR
      server</a>.
  </p>
  <p>When the job is complete, Jalview will automatically open a new
    window containing the alignment and groups that were submitted for
    analysis, with additional histograms added portraying the SHMR
    scores for each column of the sub-grouped alignment.</p>

  <p>
    <strong><em>Note:</em></strong> The Multi-Harmony service is
    implemented with a prototype of Jalview's RESTful web service client
    introduced in Jalview 2.7. A few bugs remain in this prototype,
    which we intend to fixed in version 2.7.1.
