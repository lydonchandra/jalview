    <strong>The Jalview Desktop RSS News Reader</strong><br /> The
    Jalview Desktop includes a built in news reader for the <a
      href="https://www.jalview.org/feeds/desktop/rss">Jalview
      Desktop News Channel</a>.
  </p>

  <p>We will use the desktop news channel to keep you informed of
    important updates relevant to users of the Jalview desktop, such as
    web service outages and user community events.</p>
  <p>
    The news reader will be launched automatically when you start the
    Desktop if new items are available. Should you want to browse older
    items, however, you can open it manually from the 'Jalview news
    reader' option in the Desktop's <a href="../menus/desktopMenu.html">'Tools'
      menu</a>.

  <p>
    The <em>Jalview news reader</em> was introduced in <a
      href="https://www.jalview.org/releaseHistory.html#Jalview2.7">Jalview
      version 2.7</a>. Its implementation is based on <a
      href="https://jswingreader.sourceforge.net/">JSwingReader</a>.
  </p>
  <br />
  <em>If you need to prevent the news-reader opening, then add the
    <a href="../features/clarguments.html">command-line parameter</a>
    &#39;-nonews&#39; to Jalview's command-line launch.
