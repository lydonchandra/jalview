<title>Jalview Privacy Statement</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>
    <strong>Privacy for Jalview Users</strong><br>
  <p>The Jalview Desktop application which is available from the
    www.jalview.org site does not contain code designed to collect
    personal or private information without your consent. However, we do
    collect usage statistics to work out who is using Jalview, so we can
    apply for funding to support Jalview development, and make it better
    for our users.</p>
  <p>Usage data is collected from the logs of various web services
    that the Jalview Desktop contacts through its normal operation.
    These are described below:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><em>HTTP logs on the Jalview website</em><br> We
      record IP addresses of machines which access the web site, either
      via the browser when downloading the application, or when the
      Jalview Desktop user interface is launched.<br> <br>
      <ul>
        <li><i>The Jalview Getdown Launcher</i> (Since 2.11.0) examines release
          channels every time Jalview launches to determine if a new
          release is available.</li>
        <li><i>The questionnaire web service at
            www.jalview.org/cgi-bin/questionnaire.pl is checked and a
            unique cookie for the current questionnaire is stored in the
            Jalview properties file.</i></li>
        <li><i>The Jalview web services stack is contacted to
            retrieve the currently available web services. All
            interactions with the public Jalview web services are
            logged, but we delete all job data (input data and results)
            after about two weeks.</i></li>
      </ul> <br></li>
    <li><em>Google Analytics</em><br> Since Jalview 2.4.0b2,
      the Jalview Desktop records usage data with Google Analytics via
      the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jgoogleanalytics/">JGoogleAnalytics</a>
      class.<br> The Google Analytics logs for Jalview version 2.4
      only record the fact that the application was started, but in the
      future, we will use this mechanism to improve the Desktop user
      interface, by tracking which parts of the user interface are being
      used most often.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Stopping Jalview from calling home</strong><br> If you
    run Jalview in 'headless mode' via the command line, then the
    program shouldn't try to contact any of the web servers mentioned
    above (if it does, then it's a bug!). You can also specify some <a
      href="features/commandline.html">command line options</a> to
    disable the questionnaire and usage statistics check. Finally, the <a
      href="features/preferences.html#connections">Connections
      Tab</a> of the Jalview preferences contains options for controlling
    the submission of usage statistics.
  <p>
    <strong>Other Web Clients in Jalview</strong><br> The Jalview
    desktop is intended to make it easier to interact with web-based
    bioinformatics resources. However, we can't take any responsibility
    for the integrity of any external services you might access via the
    program. Sorry!
