    <strong>Editing</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    There are two major ways to edit alignments - in 'Normal mode', gaps
    are inserted and deleted at the mouse pointer in various ways by
    clicking the left mouse button and pressing a combination of either
    shift and control (or the alt, option or apple key on Macs) and
    dragging the mouse. Pressing <em>F2</em> toggles the alternative <a
      href="../features/cursorMode.html">'Cursor mode'</a> keyboard
    editing facility, where the space bar and delete keys add and remove
    gaps at the current editing position. The key strokes for both these
    modes are summarised in the <a href="../keys.html">keystrokes
      table</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Tip:</strong> For large alignments, deselect &quot;Calculate
    -&gt; Autocalculate Consensus&quot; to prevent the alignment
    performing lengthy calculations after every edit.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Inserting / removing gaps</em> - hold down the &quot;Shift&quot;
    key. Click on a residue with the mouse and drag it to the left or
    right to insert gaps and remove gaps.<br> If the current
    selection is a group over all sequences in the alignment, or a group
    over some sequences or all columns in the alignment, then hold down
    &quot;Control&quot; key (&quot;Cmd&quot; key on OSX) and drag the residue 
    left or right to edit all sequences in the defined group at once.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Copy/paste/cut/delete</em> - any sequences which are in the
    current selection box (indicated in red) may be cut and / or copied
    to a new alignment or deleted.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Undo / redo</em> - editing of sequences (insertion/removal of
    gaps, removal of sequences, trimming sequences etc) may be undone or
    redone at any time using the appropriate menu items from the edit
    menu.
  <p>
    <em>Trimming alignment</em> - First select a column by clicking the
    scale indicator (above the sequences) The alignment may then be
    trimmed to the left or right of this column. If multiple columns are
    selected, the alignment is trimmed to the right of the rightmost
    selected column (or to the left of the leftmost selected column)
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Remove gapped columns</em> - Removes columns within the
    alignment which contain only space characters (&quot;-&quot; or
    &quot;.&quot; or &quot; &quot;)
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Removing gaps</em> - Removes all gaps from the alignment. Gaps
    are &quot;-&quot; or &quot;.&quot; or &quot; &quot;.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Set gap character</em> - Switches the gap character between
    &quot;.&quot; and &quot;-&quot;. If the &quot;Render Gaps&quot;
    option from the &quot;View&quot; menu is unticked all gaps will
    appear as blank spaces.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Editing In Selection Areas</strong>
  </p>
  Editing can be restricted to the current selection area. This allows
  the user to &quot;Lock&quot; the alignment either side of the
  selection area. Any gap insertions or deletions will only affect the
  current selection area.
  <p>
    <img src="editing.jpg" width="428" height="186" align="top">
  </p>
  <p>In this example, if Sequence IL2RA_MACMU has gaps removed from
    position 98-104, the same number of gaps will be inserted at
    position 116, (between M and L).</p>
  <p>
    <em>Locked selection area based editing was introduced in
      Jalview 2.08</em>
