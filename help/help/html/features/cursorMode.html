<title>Cursor Mode</title>

  <p>
    <strong>Cursor Mode</strong>
  </p>
  <p>Cursor mode is a new feature in Jalview 2.08, and allows more
    precise selection and editing of alignments through the use of the
    keyboard for both navigation and the input of editing and selection
    commands.</p>
  <p>
    <em>F2</em> Toggles between normal and cursor editing modes. When in
    cursor mode, a black cursor appears in the residue area of the
    alignment, and any mouse clicks on that area will move the cursor to
    that position (this means that the region selection menu is
    unavailable in cursor mode).
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Navigation</b>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Cursor (Arrow) keys</em> - Move cursor around the alignment.<br/>
    <em>Shift+Cursor key</em> - move to next gap or aligned residue</li>

    <li><em>S</em> - Type a number x then press 'S' to jump to sequence x.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><em>C</em> - Type a number x then press 'C' to jump to column x.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><em>P</em> - Type a number x then press 'P' to jump to position x in
      current sequence.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>65,82&lt;return&gt; - Quick jump to column 65, sequence 82</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>

    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>

      insert 12 spaces at the current cursor, type 12 before pressing

      with space.
    </li>
  </ul>

      position.<br> To delete 12 spaces at the current cursor, type
