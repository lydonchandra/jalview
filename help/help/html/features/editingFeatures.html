  <strong>Amending or Deleting Sequence Features</strong>
  <p>
    Double clicking a position in the alignment with one or more
    displayed sequence features opens the <strong>&quot;Amend/Delete
      Features&quot;</strong> dialog box.
  </p>

    <img src="amendfeature.gif">
  </p>
  <p>The dialog box only allows one of the features at the
    double-clicked position to be edited or deleted at a time, and it
    will also be highlighted in black in the alignment window.</p>
  <p>
    Choose which feature is to be modified by selecting it from the <strong>Sequence
      Feature Name</strong>
    <!-- and <strong>Feature Group</strong>  -->
    pull down menu. In addition to the Name, group, colour and
    description attributes described for the <a
      href="creatinFeatures.html">new feature dialog box</a>, a
    feature's start and end position can be changed either by entering a
    new position directly or by using the adjacent up and down buttons.
  </p>
  <p>
    Select <strong>Amend</strong> to update the feature, <strong>Delete</strong>
    to remove the selected feature, or <strong>Cancel</strong> to leave
    the feature unchanged.
  </p>
