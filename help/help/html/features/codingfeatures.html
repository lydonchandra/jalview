    <strong>DNA Sequence Coding Region Definition</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Jalview includes the standard DNA codon translation table in order
    to be able to dynamically translate cDNA to its expressed protein
    sequence. DNA Sequence Coding Regions are sequence features that can
    be defined on any DNA sequence in order to mark stretches of cDNA
    that will be concatenated to form the series of codons that are
    translated by the <strong>&quot; Calculate&#8594;Translate
      cDNA&quot;</strong> menu function.
