    <strong>View&#8594;Overview window</strong>
  </p>
  <p>Select the overview window menu item to get a navigable image
    of the whole alignment. By default, gaps are shown as dark grey, in
    the overview (since 2.10.2b1).</p>
  <p>The red box indicates the currently viewed region of the
    alignment, this may be moved by clicking and dragging with the
    mouse.</p>
  <p>Click anywhere else in the overview to centre the view on that
    position</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>
    <strong>Hiding hidden regions in the overview</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Hidden sequences and columns are by default shown as dark-grey rows
    and columns in the overview. Hidden regions can also be omitted
    entirely (to make the Overview 'WYSIWIG') by <strong>Right-clicking</strong>
    (or CMD-Clicking) to open the overview's popup menu.<br /> <br />
    <em>The option to include/exclude hidden regions in the
      overview was introduced in Jalview 2.10.2</em>.
