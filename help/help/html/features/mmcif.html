  <strong>What is mmCIF ?</strong>
  <br />mmCIF stands for 'macro-molecular Crystallographic Information
  File'. This format was developed by the PDB consortium and the
  International Union of Crystallography (IUCr), based on
  Crystallographic Information File (CIF), a format used for describing
  the structures of small molecules.
  <br />mmCIF became the recommended format for the exchange of
  biomacromolecular structures in 2014.
  <p>
    <strong>mmCIF and Jalview</strong> <br />Since Jalview 2.10, mmCIF
    is used for structures downloaded from the PDB. This means:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Jalview can use the mmCIF to read structures that are too
      large to be represented by a single PDB file. (ie, with more than
      >62 chains and/or 99999 ATOM records).</li>
    <li>Jalview users will have access to the richer annotation
      provided by PDBx/mmCIF files.</li>
    <li>There may be slight differences between sequences
      containing modified residues for structuresÂ downloaded in mmCIF
      format. This is because mmCIF differs from the PDB format in the
      way it describes non-standard sequence data.</li>
  </ol>

  <em>Support for importing 3D structure data from flat file and
    EMBL-PDBe as mmCIF was added in Jalview 2.10</em>
