  <p>
    <strong>Sequence Feature Reports</strong> <br /> Sequence features
    can carry a number of attributes. To view all the attributes for a
    particular sequence feature, mouse over the feature and <em>right-click</em>
    to open the <a href="../menus/popupMenu.html#featuredetails">Popup Menu</a> and
    select the feature's entry from the <em>Feature Details</em>
    submenu.

  <p>
    <em>Virtual Feature Reports</em><br /> When a sequence feature
    report is shown for features mapped between CDS and Protein
    sequences, the report will include both the original and mapped
    feature's location.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Copying and pasting annotation to other programs</strong><br>
    The <strong>File&rarr;Save</strong> option in the sequence
    annotation report window allows the report to be saved as HTML,
    which will preserve links and any other metadata. It is also
    possible to copy and paste the text to other programs, but in some
    cases, the HTML will not be preserved. In that case, you can toggle
    the display of HTML source code with the <strong>Edit&rarr;Show
      HTML Source</strong> drop down menu entry.
