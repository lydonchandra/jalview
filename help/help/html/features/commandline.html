    <strong>Running Jalview from the command line</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Jalview can be run from the command line, and provides a <a
      href="clarguments.html">range of arguments</a>.
  </p>
  <p>There are a few different ways to do this:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the <strong>jalview</strong> command that links to a <strong>launch
        script</strong>. Launch scripts are available if you are running an up to
      date version of Jalview (at least 2.11.2.0), or have installed
      Jalview via a package manager (e.g. conda, homebrew, apt).
    </li>
    <li>Embed arguments in a <strong>.JVL</strong> file. These
      files will be opened automatically by the Jalview application when
      double-clicked in a file browser on Windows and OSX.
    </li>
    <li>Execute the Jalview standalone Jar file with an existing
      Java installation</li>
      <li>For older versions of Jalview, call the <a href="#olderinstalls">native launch program directly</a>.
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong><a name="script">Jalview's command line launch
        script</a></strong>
  <p>Since version 2.11.2, the Jalview native application includes a <strong>launching shell script</strong>. This is the easiest way to
  launch an installed Jalview application from the command line. </p><p>To run the <strong>launch script</strong>, simply open a Terminal (or Command prompt on Windows), and type:<pre>
  jalview</pre>
  
  
  <p>There are some important differences between the using the launching script and launching Jalview from its icon:
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>The launching script will NOT perform automatic updates.</li>
  <li>The launching script cannot open or use JVL files.</li>
  </ul>

  <em><strong>Adding the launch script to your path</strong></em>
  <p>
    If typing 'jalview' in the terminal prompt (or windows command line)
    doesn't work then you will need to add the location of the jalview
    launch script to your
    <code>PATH</code>.</p><p>
    How you do this depends on your operating system.
  </p>

  <ul>
  
  <li>
  <p><em>In <strong>Linux</strong> or <strong>Unix</strong> (<code>jalview.sh</code>)</em></p>
  <p>Running the Linux installer will give you the option of adding a symbolic link to
  that script in your <code>$PATH</code>, if it finds a suitable place that your user can add such a
  link (e.g. <code>~/bin</code>, <code>~/.local/bin</code>, <code>~/local/bin</code>, <code>~/opt/bin</code>).  If you chose that option then
  you should be able to launch Jalview on the command line with the simple command
  <pre>jalview</pre>
  If you didn't choose that option during installation (or used an earlier version installer), or wish to make another symbolic link, you can link to the
  launching shell script with the command
  <pre>ln -s /PATH_TO_JALVIEW/bin/jalview.sh jalview</pre>
  or you could add <code>/PATH_TO_JALVIEW/bin</code> to your own <code>$PATH</code> as it already contains a symbolic link <code>jalview</code>.
  </li>
  
  <li>
  <p><em>In <strong>Windows</strong> (<code>jalview.bat</code>, <code>jalview.ps1</code>)</em></p>
  <p>The Windows installer will give you the option of adding Jalview's script folder to your <code>%PATH%</code> allowing you to launch Jalview
  in a Command Prompt simply with the command
  <pre>jalview</pre>
  If you didn't choose that option during installation (or used an earlier version installer), you can either
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>
  add the <code>\PATH_TO_JALVIEW\bin</code> folder to your <code>%PATH%</code>, or
  </li>
  <li>
  run the launcher script on the command line with its full path
  <pre>\PATH_TO_JALVIEW\bin\jalview.bat</pre>
  (you can leave off the <code>.bat</code> extension if you want).
  </li>
  </ul>
  The <code>jalview.bat</code> file is a generic wrapper around the
  PowerShell script <code>jalview.ps1</code> in the same folder.  This PowerShell script should work with both
  PowerShell 5.x (which is installed by default on all modern Windows machines), and also PowerShell 6.0+
  which might have been installed afterwards.
  </li>
  
  <li>
  <p><em>In <strong>macOS</strong> (<code>jalview</code>)</em></p>
  <p>
  We don't currently provide a macOS installer program, so you will need to add the command to you path manually. The script you should use to launch Jalview is linked to as
  <pre>/Applications/Jalview.app/Contents/MacOS/jalview</pre>
  so you can run that command with its full path, or make your own symbolic link to there, or add that folder to your <code>$PATH</code>.
  </p>
    <p>
      If you cannot see the
      <code>jalview</code>
      command in the MacOS directory, then you probably have an older
      Jalview installation. In that case, you should make a symbolic
      link directly to the launch script with the command
    <pre>ln -s /Applications/Jalview.app/Content/Resources/app/bin/jalview.sh jalview</pre>
    <em>If this doens't work, check your installation is running
      Jalview 2.11.2.0 or later.</em>
    </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
<!--  <p><em>Future</em></p>
  A future version of Jalview will include a tool to allow adding these "<code>jalview</code>" links to your <code>PATH</code> automatically.
  </li>
  
  </ul>
-->
  <p><strong><a name="olderinstalls">Older versions of Jalview</a></strong></p>
  
  <p>
  If you are using a version of Jalview prior to 2.11.2, you can still launch from the command line, but you will have to
  use a more platform specific way to launch and use command line arguments.

  <ul>
    <li>Standard installation on Linux/Unix:
    <pre>/PATH_TO_JALVIEW/Jalview -open https://www.jalview.org/examples/jpred_msa.fasta -annotations https://www.jalview.org/examples/jpred_msa.seq.concise -colour Clustal</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Standard installation on Windows:
    <pre>\PATH_TO_JALVIEW\Jalview.exe -open %HOMEPATH%\myalignment.fa</pre>
    </li>
    <li>OSX Application:
    <pre>open /Applications/Jalview.app --args -open /FULL/PATH/TO/myalignment.fa</pre>
    <em>(put all the Jalview arguments <em>after</em> the --args parameter, and note that <strong>all files must be specified with their full paths</strong>)</em>
    <br />
    <br /></li>
    <li>Jalview standalone executable Jar<pre>
        &lt;Path to Java home&gt;/bin/java -jar &lt;Path to Jalview Jar&gt;/jalview-all-1.8.jar -open myalignment.fa</pre></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you have installed Jalview via <em>conda</em> or another package
    manager then you most likely have a 'jalview' command available in
    your terminal shell's default path. Alternately, if you have built
    Jalview from source, then take a look at the doc/building.md file
    included in the source distribution.
  </p>
  <p>
    Use '-help' to get more information on the <a
      href="clarguments.html">command line arguments</a> that Jalview
    accepts.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Passing JVM Arguments to Jalview</strong><br /> If you need
    to modify parameters for Jalview's Java Virtual Machine, or
    configure system properties, then take a look at the instructions
    for how to <a href="../memory.html#jvm">setting the JVM's
      maximum memory</a>.<br /> 
  <p>
    <strong>Changing Jalview's 'Look and Feel'</strong> <br />If you
    are experiencing issues with the font size or layout of Jalview's
    GUI, you can try changing Jalview's 'Look and feel' by
    specifying a custom system property 'laf' on startup (see <a
      href="../memory.html#jvm">setting the JVM's memory</a> for
    instructions on how to do this for your platform). <br />For the
    Jalview standalone executable jar, simply provide one of the
    property settings before the -jar argument
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>-Dlaf=system (default look and feel for the OS)</li>
    <li>-Dlaf=crossplatform (Java's Metal Look and Feel)</li>
    <li>-Dlaf=nimbus (Java's alternative Nimbus Look and Feel)</li>
    <li>-Dlaf=mac (only has an effect on OSX)</li>
    <li>-Dlaf=gtk (only has an effect on Linux)</li>
    <li>-Dlaf=metal (force Java's Metal Look and Feel, default on linux)</li>
    <li>-Dlaf=quaqua (macOS only. Force attempt at old macOS theme)</li>
    <li>-Dlaf=vaqua (macOS only. Force attempt at modern macOS theme)</li>
  </ul>
  The currently configured look and feel is logged to Jalview's console.
  Once the look and feel has been changed, it will be stored in
  Jalview's .jalview_properties file for future Jalview sessions.  This property is <strong>PREFERRED_LAF</strong> and can also be used to set the Look and feel by editing your .jalview_properties file.
