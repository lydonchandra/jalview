<title>Select/Hide Columns by Annotation</title>

  <p>
    <strong>Select/Hide Columns by Annotation</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    The 'Select/Hide by Annotation' window allows columns to be selected
    or hidden according to annotation rows on the alignment. The dialog
    box is opened <em>via</em> &quot;<strong>Select&#8594;Select/Hide
      Columns by Annotation...</strong>&quot;, and different filters are then
    presented for filtering data according to the selected annotation
    row.
  </p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="AnnotationColumnSelectionWithSM.png"></td>
      <td><img src="AnnotationColumnSelectionWithoutSM.gif"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>The drop down menu lists the annotation available on the
    alignment. Sequence associated annotation rows will be shown with
    the sequence ID appended to the annotation label. It is only
    possible to select one row at a time.</p>
  <p>
    If an annotation with numeric values is selected, the threshold
    filter option is activated. For other types of annotation, use the
    text box and secondary structure check boxes (right). The radio
    buttons at the bottom of the dialog specify the action applied to
    columns matching the query.<br /> <em>Note: annotation
      containing only numeric labels (e.g. T-COFFEE column confidence
      scores) will not be treated as quantitative data. You will need to
      enter search expressions to select columns in this case.</em>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Search Filter</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Enter text or regular expressions in the text box to
          activate the 'Display Label' and 'Description' options.</li>
        <li>Selecting the description or label options will
          activate the filter, and any matching columns will be
          highlighted or hidden.</li>
      </ul>
    <li><strong>Structure Filter</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Select the checkboxes to filter by secondary structure
          type.</li>
      </ul>
    <li><strong>Threshold Filter</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>This filter is only activated for annotation which
          contain numeric values</li>
        <li>Select whether to filter the alignment above or below
          the threshold.</li>
        <li>Change the threshold value with the slider, or enter it
          in the text box.
	<li>The <em>As Percentage</em> checkbox allows thresholds to
          be set as a percentage rather than absolute value.</li>
      </ul>
    <li><strong>Actions</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>'Select' (the default), selects columns matching the
          query settings.</li>
        <li>'Hide' causes matching columns to be hidden.</li>
      </ul></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Hit 'Cancel' to restore the alignment view to its previous
    state before any filtering was applied.</p>
