  <p>
    <strong>Sequence Fetcher</strong>
  </p>
	<p>Jalview can retrieve sequences from a range of sequence, 3D
		structure, genomic and domain family databases provided by EMBL-EBI.</p>
	<p>The Sequence Fetcher can be opened via the &quot;File&quot;
    menu on the main desktop in order to retrieve sequences as a new
    alignment, or opened via the &quot;File&quot; menu of an existing
    alignment to import additional sequences. There may be a short delay
    when the sequence fetcher is first opened, whilst Jalview contacts each database's web API.</p>
  <p>
    Every time a new fetcher is opened, you will need to <strong>select
      the database you want to retrieve sequences</strong> from the database
    chooser.
  </p>
  <img src="selectfetchdb.gif" align="left"
    alt="Database selection dialog for fetching sequences (introduced in Jalview 2.8)">
  <p>
    The databases are shown as a tree, and ordered alphabetically;
    tooltips are shown if you mouse over some sources, explaining what
    the database will retrieve. You can select one by using the up/down
    arrow keys and hitting return, or by double clicking with the mouse.
  </p>
  <p>Once you have selected a sequence database, its fetcher dialog
    will open. Jalview provides two types of dialog:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>The Free-text Search Interface</strong> <br />Free-text
      search clients are provided for PDB (Since 2.9), and UniProt
      (Since 2.10). They provide access to each database's own query
      system, enabling you to retrieve data by accession, free text
      description, or any other type of supported field. For full
      details, see each client's help page:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="pdbsequencefetcher.html">PDB Sequence
            Fetcher</a></li>
        <li><a href="uniprotsequencefetcher.html">UniProt
            Sequence Fetcher</a></li>
      </ul></li>
    <li><strong>Accession based sequence retrieval</strong> <br />

      <img src="seqfetcher.gif" align="center"
      alt="The Jalview Sequence Fetcher Dialog Box"><br /> To
      retrieve sequences, simply <strong>enter one or more
        accession ids</strong> (as a semi-colon separated list), or press the
      &quot;Example&quot; button to paste the example accession for the
      currently selected database into the retrieval box. Finally, press
      &quot;OK&quot; to initiate the retrieval.
      <br />
      For the PDB and UniProt sequence fetchers, choose the "Retrieve IDs" tab
      to search for accession ids.</li>
  </ol>
