  <p>
    <strong>Jalview Launch Files - JVL</strong>
  </p>
  <p>Files with a '.jvl' (or .JVL) extension can be opened by the
    Jalview desktop application, and allow you to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Switch between different Jalview Versions</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Configure the <a href="../memory.html">proportion
          of memory</a> allocated to Jalview
    </strong></li>
    <li><strong>Import data and pass <a
        href="clarguments.html">command line arguments</a></strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Some example JVL files are given below - copy and paste them into a
    text editor and save them as a file with the extension '.jvl'. To
    test, open your saved .jvl file via the OSX File Chooser or Windows
    file explorer, or pass it to Jalview via the <a
      href="./commandline.html">command line</a>
  </p>
