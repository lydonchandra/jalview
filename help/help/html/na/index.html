    <strong>Nucleic Acid Support</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Colour Schemes</em>
  </p>
  <p>Jalview has color schemes for nucleic acid based sequences,
    ability to fetch sequences from RFAM and RNA secondary structure
    coloring</p>
  <p>
    Information on the <a href="../colourSchemes/nucleotide.html">Nucleotide
      colour scheme</a> and <a href="../colourSchemes/purinepyrimidine.html">
      Purine/Pyrimidine colour scheme</a> are available under the Colour
    Menu. See <a href="../colourSchemes/index.html">Colour Schemes</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>RNA Support</em>
  </p>
  Jalview supports annotation of RNA sequences with secondary structure
  information. You can interactively
  <a href="../features/annotation.html#rna">create and edit RNA
    secondary structure annotation rows</a>, or import data in the following
  way:
  <ul>
    <li><em>RFAM</em> - Sequences can be <a
      href="../features/seqfetch.html">fetched</a> from the RFAM
      database by accession number or ID.</li>
    <li><em>Stockholm files</em> - WUSS (or VIENNA) dot-bracket
      notation found in the secondary structure annotation line will be
      imported as sequence or alignment associated secondary structure
      annotation.</li>
    <li><em>Clustal files</em> - certain RNA alignment programs,
      such as <a href="http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/LocARNA">LocaRNA</a>
      output consensus RNA secondary structure lines in the line
      normally reserved for the Clustal consensus line in a clustal
      file.</li>
    <li><em>RNAML</em> Jalview can import RNAML files containing
      sequences and extended secondary structure annotation derived from
      RNA 3D structure</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>RNA Secondary Structure Visualization and Analysis</strong><br />
    If a sequence or RNA alignment has secondary structure information,
    the alignment will have a secondary structure line shown below it,
    and a number of additional options become available:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="../colourSchemes/rnahelicesColouring.html">RNA
        Helix colouring</a> - highlights columns of alignment involved in
      particular RNA helices, Uses the first displayed secondary
      structure annotation.</li>
    <li><a href="../calculations/structureconsensus.html">Base
        Pair Conservation Analysis</a> - shown as a histogram and base-pair
      logo below the alignment. Uses the first displayed secondary
      structure annotation row.</li>
    <li><a href="../features/varna.html">2D Structure
        Visualization in VARNA</a> - allows linked viewing of the consensus
      or an individual sequence's structure. Accessed via the Sequence
      ID popup menu.</li>
    <li><strong>per sequence secondary structure
        annotation</strong><br /> Sequence associated secondary structure
      annotation imported via stockholm, PDB files, or other sources can
      be shown on the alignment with the <strong>Colours&#8594;By
        Annotation</strong> dialog box. Colours are assigned according to RNA
      helix topology number (number of distinct nested helices).
      Alignments can also be sorted by RNA helix secondary structure
      topology number, <em>via</em> the <strong>Calculations&#8594;Sort&#8594;By
        Annotation&#8594;Secondary Structure</strong> option (only present when
      per-sequence secondary structure is available).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Pseudo-knots</strong><br /> Jalview 2.8.2 introduced
    limited support for working with structures including pseudoknots.
    Where possible, extended WUSS symbols (e.g. different types of
    parentheses, or upper and lower case letters) are preserved when
    parsing RNA structure annotation and will be shaded differently when
    displayed in the structure.<br /> Extended WUSS annotation is also
    employed to distinguish different base pair interactions obtained
    from RNAML files.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Limitations when working with RNA in Jalview</strong><br />
    Currently, Jalview is not able to export RNA secondary structure
    annotation in any format other than Jalview annotation </br> <em>Jalview's
      RNA handling capabilities were introduced in v2.8</em>
