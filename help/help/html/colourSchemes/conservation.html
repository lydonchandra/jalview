    <strong>Colouring by Conservation</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    This is an approach to alignment colouring which highlights regions
    of an alignment where physicochemical properties are conserved. It
    is based on the one used in the AMAS method of multiple sequence
    alignment analysis (Livingstone C.D. and Barton G.J. (1993), Protein
    Sequence Alignments: A Strategy for the Hierarchical Analysis of
    Residue Conservation.CABIOS Vol. 9 No. 6 (745-756)). See the <a
      href="../calculations/conservation.html">conservation
      calculation</a> help page for a more thorough explanation of the
    calculation.
  </p>
  <p>For an already coloured alignment, the conservation index at
    each alignment position is used to modify the shading intensity of
    the colour at that position. This means that the most conserved
    columns in each group have the most intense colours, and the least
    conserved are the palest. The slider controls the contrast between
    these extremes.</p>
  <p>
    Conservation can be calculated over all sequences in an alignment,
    or just within specific groups (such as those defined by <a
      href="../calculations/tree.html">phylogenetic tree
      partitioning</a>). The option 'apply to all groups' controls whether
    the contrast slider value will be applied to the indices for the
    currently selected group, or all groups defined over the alignment.
