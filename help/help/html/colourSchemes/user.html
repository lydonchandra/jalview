    You may define any number of new colour schemes, each with a unique
    name. <br> <br> Each of the residues in a colour scheme
    may be assigned any chosen colour. <br> Select one or more
    residues, then select the desired colour.<br /> Use Ctrl-click to
    select multiple residues, or click then Shift-click to select a
    block.<br /> Note that the currently selected buttons are
    highlighted by a lighter text colour.
  <p>
    The <strong>Case Sensitive</strong> option allows you to choose
    distinct colours for upper and lower case residue codes.
  <p>
    The <strong>Colour All Lower Case	</strong> option allows you to apply a selected colour
    to all lower case residues.
  <p>
    Click <strong>Apply</strong> or <strong>OK</strong> to set your new
    colours on the active alignment window.<br /> Click <strong>Cancel</strong>
    to undo your changes if you pressed the <strong>Apply</strong>
    button.
  </p>
  If you save your colour scheme with a unique name, the colour scheme
  name will be added to the
  <strong>Colour</strong> menu on each new alignment window.
  <br>
  <br> Any saved colour schemes will be automatically loaded the
  next time you use Jalview.
