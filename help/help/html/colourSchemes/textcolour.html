  <strong>Background Dependent Text Colour</strong>
  <p>
    The <strong>Colour&#8594;Text Colour</strong> menu entry opens the <strong>&quot;Adjust
      Foreground Text Colour Threshold&quot;</strong> dialog box, allowing the
    colour of symbols rendered on dark or light backgrounds to be set
    for the current selection or the whole alignment.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>The dialog box contains a slider, and two colour icons showing
    the text colour for dark backgrounds (left hand end of slider), and
    light backgrounds (right hand end of slider). Drag the slider to
    change the threshold for transitioning between dark and light
    background colours, and select either of the colour boxes to open a
    colour chooser to select a different text colour.</p>
