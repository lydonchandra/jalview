    <strong>Colouring above a percentage identity threshold</strong>
  </p>
  <p>Selecting this option causes the colour scheme to be applied to
    only those residues that occur in that column at least a certain
    percentage of the time. For instance, selecting the threshold to be
    100 will only colour those columns with 100% identity, and selecting 50 will shade residues appearing in least 50% of the rows (or sequences) in each column.</p>
   <p>The percentage calculation may include or exclude gaps in the column, depending on the option selected for the <a href="../calculations/consensus.html">consensus calculation</a>.</p>
   <p>With a threshold of 0, colouring is unchanged.</p>
