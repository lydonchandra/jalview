    <strong> RNA Helices Colouring </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    An RNA alignment loaded from a Stockholm file can be coloured based
    on its helices. The helices are determined from the secondary
    structure line in the Stockholm file (#GC SS_cons) written in WUSS
    notation that specifies base pairing. See <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_format">
      Wikipedia</a> or <a
      href="http://jalview-rnasupport.blogspot.com/2010/06/parsing-wuss-notation-of-rna-secondary.html">
      Jalview RNA Support Blog</a> for more information about Stockholm
    files and WUSS notation.
  </p>
  Select &quot;Colour&quot;
  <strong>&#8594;</strong> &quot; By RNA Helices&quot; to colour the
  alignment by RNA helices.
