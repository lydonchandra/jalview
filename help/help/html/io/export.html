  </p>
  <p>
    The alignment view can be printed using <strong>File&#8594;Print</strong>,
    or exported in a number of ways via the <strong>File&#8594;Export</strong>
    menu:
  <ul>
    <li>HTML<br> <em>for viewing in a web browser</em>
    </li>
    <li>PNG - a Portable Networks Graphics image<br> <em>For
        low quality diagrams and powerpoint presentations</em>
    </li>
    <li>EPS - an Encapsulated Postscript Document<br> <em>For
        high quality diagrams and publications.</em>
    <li>SVG - a Scalable Vector Graphics document<br> <em>For
        high quality diagrams in publications and on the web.</em>
    </li>
    <li>BioJS MSA - A JavaScript based multiple sequence alignment
      viewer. <br> <em>For interactive alignment data
        visualisation in a web browser.<br />Get more info about the
        BioJS MSA viewer at <a href="http://msa.biojs.net/">http://msa.biojs.net/</a>

    <strong>Exporting alignments as Web Pages</strong>
  <p>
    In Jalview 2.9, new HTML exporting options were introduced. The
    standard HTML export option displays alignments as SVG documents
    embedded as scrollable panes. Exported pages can optionally also
    include <a href="../features/bioJsonFormat.html">BioJSON</a> data,
    which allows Jalview to extract the original data used to create the
    page. Jalview can also generate HTML pages which embed BioJSON data
    and the BioJS MSA viewer, a pure javascript alignment viewer that
    provides a range of interactive analysis capabilities.

    <strong>Tips for working with EPS Files</strong>
  </p>
  <li>The EPS file generated by Jalview contains vector graphics
    which are directly editable in graphics applications such as Adobe
    Illustrator.</li>
  <li>EPS files can be produced as &quot;Text&quot; or
    &quot;Lineart&quot;. Use &quot;Text&quot; if you want the final
    document to be MUCH smaller in diskspace and be able to search, edit
    and select text. Use &quot;Lineart&quot; if you want an exact image
    of the alignment as displayed in Jalview. This is useful if a 3rd
    Party EPS viewer does not have the same Font which the EPS file was
    created with.</li>
  <li>When importing an EPS file into a Microsoft office document,
    a snapshot image of the file will be displayed which often looks
    blurred. Right-click the image and choose &quot;Edit image.&quot; to
    convert it to word drawing objects which give a truer WYSIWIG
    representation.</li>
  <li>EPS does not support colour transparency, so will not reproduce this
    if used for <a href="../features/featuresettings.html#transparency">feature colouring</a>.</li>
  <li>Mac OSX users will find that eps files are automatically
    converted into PDF files.</li>
