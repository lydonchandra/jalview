    <strong>Modeller PIR Format IO</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    The homology modelling program, <a
      href="http://salilab.org/modeller/">Modeller</a> uses a
    special form of the PIR format where information about sequence
    numbering and chain codes are written into the 'description' line
    between the PIR protein tag and the protein alignment entry:
  </p>
  <pre>&gt;P1;Q93Z60_ARATH
sequence:Q93Z60_ARATH:1:.:118:.:.

</pre>
  <p>Jalview will attempt to parse any PIR entries conforming to the
    Modeller/PIR format, in order to extract the sequence start and end
    numbering and (possibly) a PDB file reference. The description line
    information is always stored in the sequence description string - so
    no information is lost if this parsing process fails.</p>
  <p>
    The 'Modeller Output' flag in the 'Output' tab of the Jalview <a
      href="../features/preferences.html">Preferences dialog
      box</a> controls whether Jalview will also output MODELLER style PIR
    files. In this case, any existing 'non-modeller PIR' header
    information in the description string of an alignment is appended to
    an automatically generated modeller description line for that
    sequence.
  </p>
  <p>The general format used for generating the Modeller/PIR
    sequence description line is shown below :
  <pre>&gt;P1;<em>Primary_Sequence_ID</em>
<em>sequence or structureX</em>:<em>pdb-reference if
  available</em>:<em>start residue</em>:<em>start chain code</em>:<em>end
  residue</em>:<em>end chain code</em>:. <em>description text</em>
  </pre>
  The first field is either sequence or structureX, depending upon the
  presence of a PDB database ID for the sequence. If the protein has no
  PDB reference, then the chain code is not specified, unless one
  already existed when the sequence was imported into Jalview.
