    <strong>Removing redundancy</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Selecting the option in the Alignment window's <strong>Edit</strong>
    menu or pressing <strong>'CONTROL+D'</strong> brings up a dialog box
    asking you to select a threshold. If the percentage identity between
    the aligned positions of any two sequences in the visible alignment
    exceeds this value, the shorter sequence is discarded.<br> <em>Note:</em>
    The redundancy calculation is done when the dialog box is opened.
    For large numbers of sequences this can take a long time as all
    pairs have to be compared.
