    <strong>The Alignment Calculations Dialog</strong>

  <p>
    The <strong>Calculations Dialog</strong> (shown above) is opened via
    the <strong>Calculations&#8594;Calculate Tree or PCA...</strong>
    menu entry.
  </p>
  <p>
    It allows you to select the type of alignment analysis calculation (<a
      href="pca.html">PCA</a> or <a href="tree.html">Tree</a>), and the
    sequence similarity score model that will be used to perform the
    analysis.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Adding additional score models</strong><br />Jalview can
    import substitution matrices in both <a
      href="http://www.genome.jp/aaindex/aaindex_help.html">AAindex</a>
    and NCBI format (see e.g. <a
      href="http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/matrices/">ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/matrices/</a>).
    In Jalview 2.10.2, the easiest way to import new models is to drag
    the score model file onto any alignment window. See the <a
      href="scorematrices.html">Substitution Matrices Documentation</a>
    for more information.
