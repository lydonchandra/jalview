<title>Pairwise Alignment</title>

  <p>
    <strong>Pairwise alignment (Proteins only)</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    This calculation is performed on the selected sequences only. Java
    is not the fastest language in the world and aligning more than a
    handful of sequences will take a fair amount of time. <br> For
    each pair of sequences the best global alignment is found using
    BLOSUM62 as the scoring matrix. The scores reported are the raw
    scores. The sequences are aligned using a dynamic programming
    technique and using the following gap penalties :
  </p>
  <p>
    Gap open : 12 <br> Gap extend : 2
  </p>
  <p>When you select the pairwise alignment option, a new window
    will come up which displays the alignments in a text format, for
    example:</p>
  <p>
  <pre>
    FER1_SPIOL/5-13 TTMMGMAT<br />
                    |. .. ||<br />
    FER1_MESCR/5-15 TAALSGAT
    </pre>
  shows the aligned sequences, where '|' links identical residues, and
  (for peptide) '.' links residues that have a positive PAM250 score.
  <p>The window also shows information about the alignment such as
    alignment score, length and percentage identity between the
    sequences.</p>
  <p>A button is also provided to allow you to view the sequences as
    an alignment.</p>
