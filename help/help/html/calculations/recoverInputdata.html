    <strong>Viewing Input Data to PCA and Tree calculations</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    It is always possible to retrieve the input data used to calculate a
    tree or PCA plot by using the analysis window's <strong>&quot;File
      -&gt; Input Data...&quot;</strong> menu item. The Input Data will be shown
    in a new alignment window, with any hidden columns preserved.
