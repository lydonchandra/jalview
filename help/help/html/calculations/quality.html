    <strong>Alignment Quality Annotation</strong>
  </p>
  <p>Alignment Quality is one of the automatically calculated
    quantitative alignment annotations displayed below the columns of a
    multiple sequence alignment (and can be used to shade the
    alignment). It is an ad-hoc measure of the likelihood of observing
    the mutations (if any) in a particular column of the alignment.</p>
  <p>More precisely, the quality score is inversely proportional to
    the average cost of all pairs of mutations observed in a particular
    column of the alignment - a high alignment quality score for a
    column would suggest that there are no mutations, or most mutations
    observed are favourable.</p>

  <p>
    <em>The Algorithm</em><br> The quality score is calculated for
    each column in an alignment by summing, for all mutations, the ratio
    of the two BLOSUM 62 scores for a mutation pair and each residue's
    conserved BLOSUM62 score (which is higher). This value is normalised
    for each column, and then plotted on a scale from 0 to 1.
  </p>
  <p>Multiple alignment algorithms using the BLOSUM 62 substitution
    matrices should, in theory, maximise alignment quality for an
    un-gapped alignment, and locally maximise quality for gapped
    alignments.</p>
