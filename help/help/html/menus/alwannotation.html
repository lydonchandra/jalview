    <strong>Alignment Window Annotations Menu</strong> <em>Since
      Jalview 2.8.2</em>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Show Alignment Related</strong><em><br>
        Show all annotations that are for the alignment as a whole (for
        example, Consensus, or secondary structure prediction from
        alignment)).</em></li>
    <li><strong>Hide Alignment Related</strong><em><br>
        Hide all annotations that are for the alignment as a whole.</em></li>
    <li><strong>Show Sequence Related</strong><em><br>
        Show all annotations that are for individual sequences.</em></li>
    <li><strong>Hide Sequence Related</strong><em><br>
        Hide all annotations that are for individual sequences.</em></li>
    <li><strong>Show Alignment Related</strong><em><br>
        Show all annotations that are for the alignment as a whole (for
        example, Consensus).</em></li>
    <li><em>You can also selectively show or hide annotations
        from the <a href="./popupMenu.html">Popup</a> or <a
        href="../features/annotation.html">Annotation</a> menus.
    </em></li>
    <li><strong>Sort by Sequence</strong><em><br>Sort
        sequence-specific annotations by sequence order in the alignment
        (and within that, by label).</em></li>
    <li><strong>Sort by Label</strong><em><br>Sort
        sequence-specific annotations by label (and within that, by
        sequence order). If neither sort order is selected, no sorting
        is applied, allowing you to make a manual ordering of the
        annotations.</em></li>
    <li><strong>Autocalculated Annotation<br>
    </strong><em>Settings for the display of autocalculated annotation.</em>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Show first<br></strong><em> Show
            autocalculated annotations above sequence-specific
            annotations. Note this also applies to other annotations for
            the alignment, for example secondary structure prediction
            from alignment.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Show last<br></strong><em> Show
            autocalculated / alignment annotations below
            sequence-specific annotations.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Apply to all groups<br>
        </strong><em> When ticked, any modification to the current settings
            will be applied to all autocalculated annotation.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Show Consensus Histogram<br>
        </strong><em> Enable or disable the display of the histogram above
            the consensus sequence.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Show Consensus Logo<br>
        </strong><em> Enable or disable the display of the Consensus Logo
            above the consensus sequence.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Normalise Consensus Logo<br>
        </strong><em>When enabled, scales all logo stacks to the same
            height, making it easier to compare symbol diversity in
            highly variable regions.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Group Conservation<br>
        </strong><em> When ticked, display a conservation row for all groups
            (only available for protein alignments).</em></li>
        <li><strong>Group Consensus<br>
        </strong><em> When ticked, display a consensus row for all groups.</em></li>
