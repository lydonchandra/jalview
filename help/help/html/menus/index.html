    <strong>Jalview's Menus</strong>
  </p>
  <p>Menus are used in 3 places in Jalview - the &quot;Desktop
    Menu&quot;, the &quot;Alignment Menu&quot; and the &quot;Popup
    Menu&quot;.</p>
  <p>
    The <a href="desktopMenu.html">Desktop Menu</a> is always visible
    and is the starting point for loading new alignments.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <a href="alignmentMenu.html">Alignment Window Menus</a> are
    accessible once an alignment has been opened.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <a href="popupMenu.html">Popup Menus</a> are opened by clicking
    with the right mouse button in the alignment display area or on a
    sequence label in the alignment window.<br /> <em><strong>Mac
        Users:</strong> pressing CTRL whilst clicking the mouse/track pad is the
      same as a right-click. See your system's settings to configure
      your track-pad's corners to generate right-clicks.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    The <a href="alwannotationpanel.html">Annotations Menu</a> is opened
    by right-clicking on an annotation row label or in an annotation
    row.
