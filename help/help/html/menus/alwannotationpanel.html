    <strong>Annotation Panel Menus</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Annotation Label Popup Menu</strong><br> <em>This
        menu is opened by clicking anywhere on the annotation row labels
        area (below the sequence ID area).</em> <br />
    <em><strong>Mac Users:</strong> pressing CTRL whilst clicking
        the mouse/track pad is the same as a right-click. See your
        system's settings to configure your track-pad's corners to
        generate right-clicks.</em>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Add New Row</strong><br> <em>Adds a
            new, named annotation row (a dialog box will pop up for you
            to enter the label for the new row). </em></li>
        <li><strong>Edit Label/Description</strong><br> <em>This
            opens a dialog where you can change the name (displayed
            label), or the description (as shown on the label tooltip)
            of the clicked annotation. </em></li>
        <li><strong>Hide This Row</strong><br> <em>Hides
            the annotation row whose label was clicked in order to bring
            up the menu.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Hide All <em>&lt;label&gt;</em></strong><br>
          <em>Hides all annotation rows whose label matches the one
            clicked. (This option is only shown for annotations that
            relate to individual sequences, not for whole alignment
            annotations. Since Jalview 2.8.2.)</em></li>
        <li><strong>Delete Row</strong><br> <em>Deletes
            the annotation row whose label was clicked in order to bring
            up the menu.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Show All Hidden Rows</strong><br> <em>Shows
            all hidden annotation rows.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Export Annotation</strong> <em>(Application
            only)</em><br> <em>Annotations can be saved to file or
            output to a text window in either the Jalview annotations
            format or as a spreadsheet style set of comma separated
            values (CSV). </em></li>
        <li><strong>Show Values in Text Box</strong> <em>(applet
            only)</em><br> <em>Opens a text box with a list of
            comma-separated values corresponding to the annotation
            (numerical or otherwise) at each position in the row. This
            is useful to export alignment quality measurements for
            further analysis.</em></li>
      </ul> <em>The following additional entries are available when the
        popup menu is opened on a consensus sequence annotation row:</em>
      <ul>

        <li><strong>Ignore Gaps in Consensus</strong><br> If
          this checkbox is selected, all consensus calculations
          performed in the current Alignment window will be done without
          counting gaps as a consensus character.</li>
        <li><strong>Show Consensus Histogram<br></strong>
          Enable or disable the display of the histogram above the
          consensus sequence.</li>
        <li><strong>Show Consensus Logo<br></strong> Enable or
          disable the display of the sequence logo above the consensus
          sequence.</li>
        <li><strong>Normalise Consensus Logo<br>
        </strong><em>When enabled, scales all logo stacks to the same
            height, making it easier to compare symbol diversity in
            highly variable regions.</em></li>

        <li>
        <li><strong>Copy Consensus Sequence</strong><br>
          Copies the consensus sequence to the clipboard in Fasta
          format, to allow the consensus sequence to be added to an
          alignment. Note the copied sequence is not accessible to other
          programs if Jalview is running as an applet in a web page.</li>
      </ul></li>
    <li><strong>Annotation Popup Menu<br>
    </strong><em>This menu is opened when right-clicking on the selected
        positions of an annotation.</em>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Helix</strong><br> <em>Mark selected
            positions with a helix glyph (a red oval), and optional text
            label (see below). Consecutive ovals will be rendered as an
            unbroken red line.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Sheet</strong><br> <em>Mark selected
            positions with a sheet glyph (a green arrow oriented from
            left to right), and optional text label (see below).
            Consecutive arrows will be joined together to form a single
            green arrow.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Label</strong><br> <em>Sets the text
            label at the selected positions. If more than one
            consecutive position is marked with the same label, only the
            first position's label will be rendered.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Colour</strong><br> <em>Changes the
            colour of the annotation text label.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Remove Annotation</strong><br> <em>Blanks
            any annotation at the selected positions on the row. Note: <strong>This
              cannot be undone</strong>
        </em></li>
